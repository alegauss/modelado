### §MOD46 Round trip between Blender and the window

"Edit in Modelado" in the add-on exports the object to a session folder and launches
Modelado.exe --blender-session <folder>, which opens it with its name in the caption. In
that mode the toolbar gains "Send to Blender". It writes the current version to the
session folder and signals the add-on, which polls the folder with a Blender timer and
replaces the object's mesh data as MOD43 does: transform, materials and collections
kept, and one Blender undo step.

Several sends are fine, each a new undo step in Blender. Closing the window ends the
session. In the other direction, the standalone window's Export card gains "Open in
Blender", which finds Blender (registry, then the user's path preference) and starts it
importing the model.

Done when an object goes to the window, gets three edits, is sent back twice, and both
sends undo in Blender in order.
